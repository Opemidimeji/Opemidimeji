- 👋 Hi, I’m Opemidimeji Osatoyinbo
- 👀 I’m interested in building responsive and appealing websites (using HTML, CSS, Javascript and React) to meet clients' needs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and improving on my basic programming languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript and React) while I also explore other programming languages to meet every client need.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects, I'm open to internships and also open to take up Front-end Developer roles (remotely).
